# Flight Control Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

- **Name:** Flight Control
- **Purpose:** AI-driven code analysis & refactoring platform for modern codebases, supporting domain-specific fine-tuning, scalable modular architecture, and advanced developer tooling.
- **Tech Stack:** React, Vite, Tailwind, TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, PyTorch, Transformers, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Docusaurus, Swagger, Jest, Pytest, Cypress.

## 2. Milestones & Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Scaffolding

- [x] Define project structure and create all directories.
- [x] Scaffold frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind + TypeScript) with branding and stubs.
- [x] Scaffold backend (FastAPI) with health-check endpoint and test stub.
- [x] Scaffold AI/ML (PyTorch/Transformers) with training/inference stubs.
- [x] Scaffold infrastructure (Dockerfiles, docker-compose, k8s, Terraform).
- [x] Scaffold CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Snyk, ArgoCD).
- [x] Scaffold documentation (Docusaurus, Swagger) with stubs.
- [x] Scaffold shared utilities and test stubs for all modules.

### Phase 2: Core Feature Development

- [x] Implement code analysis API endpoints and service logic (mock result, TODOs for ML integration).
- [x] Integrate Monaco Editor and code metrics dashboard in frontend (wired to backend, TODOs for LSP, debouncing, loading state).
- [x] Implement model training, synthetic data generation, and validation scripts (with TODOs for advanced logic).
- [x] Set up database models, migrations, and Redis caching (with TODOs for Alembic and advanced config).
- [x] Develop initial CI/CD pipelines and local dev workflows.

### Phase 3: Integration & Local Validation

- [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs (fully integrated: analysis, git, models, health).
- [x] Validate local development with Docker Compose and CI workflows.
- [x] Run and pass all test stubs (frontend, backend, ai-ml).
- [x] Document setup, contribution, and troubleshooting in Docusaurus.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Cloud Readiness

- [x] Expand backend endpoints (auth, git integration, model management, feedback).
- [x] Add advanced frontend features (diff viewer, settings, docs portal, git clone UI, model selection UI).
- [x] Integrate Kubernetes manifests and Terraform AWS modules.
- [x] Add model retraining and deployment workflows in CI/CD.
- [x] Enhance documentation and accessibility (usage examples, OpenAPI, user guides).
- [x] Add Vault & MinIO deployment guides ([infrastructure/README.md](infrastructure/README.md)).
- [x] Add JWT key rotation and refresh token handling ([backend/README.md](backend/README.md), [docs/src/docs/security.md](docs/src/docs/security.md)).
- [x] Add in-app feedback form and GitHub Issue integration ([docs/src/docs/feedback.md](docs/src/docs/feedback.md)).

### Phase 5: Pilot & Feedback

- [x] Deploy pilot on cloud (AWS, GCP, or local k8s).
- [x] Collect feedback from early users.
- [x] Iterate on features, performance, and documentation.

## 4. Review & Update Process

- **Weekly Review:** Update project plan and changelog at the end of each week or after major milestones.
- **PR Checklist:** Every pull request should reference the changelog and update documentation as needed.
- **Retrospective:** At the end of each phase, review progress, blockers, and adjust the plan.
- **Documentation:** Ensure Docusaurus and all docs are kept up to date with new features, setup, and troubleshooting notes.

---

## 5. Next Steps

- [ ] Advanced model selection and configuration in frontend and backend.
- [ ] User feedback-driven improvements and new feature planning.
- [ ] Production hardening: monitoring, alerting, scaling, and security audits.
- [ ] Expand test coverage (frontend, backend, e2e).
- [ ] Prepare for public release and onboarding external contributors.

## Post-Alpha Suggestions & Enhancements

- **Advanced Model Selection Logic:** Implement true multi-model support in backend and frontend, allowing users to select and switch between models at runtime.
- **Production Hardening:**
  - Add monitoring and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, etc.).
  - Implement auto-scaling and load balancing for backend and AI/ML services.
  - Conduct formal security audits and penetration testing.
  - Enable audit logs for all critical actions (Vault, MinIO, user actions).
- **Test Coverage:**
  - Expand integration and end-to-end (e2e) tests (e.g., Cypress for frontend, multi-endpoint backend tests).
  - Add tests for error and edge cases.
- **User Feedback Loop:**
  - Use feedback data to drive feature prioritization and bug fixes.
  - Consider in-app surveys or analytics (self-hosted, privacy-respecting).
- **Code Ownership & Contribution:**
  - Assign code owners/maintainers for each major module.
  - Document process for adding new models, endpoints, or UI features.
- **Upgrade & Versioning:**
  - Add documentation for upgrading the platform and handling breaking changes.
  - Consider semantic versioning and release notes for each version.
- **Security & Compliance:**
  - Schedule regular dependency scans (Snyk, Dependabot).
  - Review and update compliance documentation as needed.
