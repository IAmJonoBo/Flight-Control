# Post-Alpha Suggestions & Enhancements

## Advanced Model Selection Logic
- Implement true multi-model support in backend and frontend, allowing users to select and switch between models at runtime.

## Production Hardening
- Add monitoring and alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, etc.).
- Implement auto-scaling and load balancing for backend and AI/ML services.
- Conduct formal security audits and penetration testing.
- Enable audit logs for all critical actions (Vault, MinIO, user actions).

## Test Coverage
- Expand integration and end-to-end (e2e) tests (e.g., Cypress for frontend, multi-endpoint backend tests).
- Add tests for error and edge cases.

## User Feedback Loop
- Use feedback data to drive feature prioritization and bug fixes.
- Consider in-app surveys or analytics (self-hosted, privacy-respecting).

## Code Ownership & Contribution
- Assign code owners/maintainers for each major module.
- Document process for adding new models, endpoints, or UI features.

## Upgrade & Versioning
- Add documentation for upgrading the platform and handling breaking changes.
- Consider semantic versioning and release notes for each version.

## Security & Compliance
- Schedule regular dependency scans (Snyk, Dependabot).
- Review and update compliance documentation as needed.
