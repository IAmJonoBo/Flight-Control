# Review & Update Process

- **Weekly Review:** Update project plan and changelog at the end of each week or after major milestones.
- **PR Checklist:** Every pull request should reference the changelog and update documentation as needed.
- **Retrospective:** At the end of each phase, review progress, blockers, and adjust the plan.
- **Documentation:** Ensure Docusaurus and all docs are kept up to date with new features, setup, and troubleshooting notes.
