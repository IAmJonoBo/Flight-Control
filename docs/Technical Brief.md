### **Executive Summary**
This document outlines a technical roadmap for developing a scalable, AI-driven code analysis and refactoring platform. The platform integrates **domain-specific fine-tuning**, **scalable analysis architectures**, and **advanced tooling** to address challenges in code quality, scalability, and user experience. Key enhancements include:
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** with LoRA and spectral regularization.
- **Synthetic data generation** validated via CodeBERTScore and human-in-the-loop pipelines.
- **Modular, scalable analysis** using Nx, Kubernetes, and caching layers.
- **Domain-specific validation** on Spring Boot monorepos (e.g., Spring PetClinic).

---

### **Technical Deep Dive**

#### **1. AI/ML Pipeline Enhancements**
**Objective**: Improve model accuracy, efficiency, and robustness for domain-specific tasks.

##### **a. LoRA Fine-Tuning Stability**
- **Challenge**: Intruder dimensions in LoRA can destabilize models.
- **Solutions**:
  1. **Rank Stabilization**: Use higher LoRA ranks (e.g., r=32 vs. r=8) to align closer to full fine-tuning.
  2. **Spectral Regularization**: Penalize deviations in singular values during training.
     ```python
     # Example: Spectral Regularization with PyTorch
     import torch
     from torch.nn.utils.parametrizations import spectral_norm

     # Apply spectral normalization to attention layers
     model.query = spectral_norm(model.query)
     model.value = spectral_norm(model.value)
     ```

##### **b. Synthetic Data Generation & Validation**
- **Generation**:
  - Use **CodeGen** or **Codex** to generate code samples with specific code smells (e.g., God Methods).
  - Validate with **Semgrep** rules to filter invalid syntax.
- **Validation**:
  1. **CodeBERTScore**: Compare synthetic code to real datasets (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/MLforSW/CodeAnalysis-ML`).
  2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Engage developers to annotate synthetic samples for realism.

---

#### **2. Scalable Codebase Analysis**
**Objective**: Optimize performance and resource utilization for large codebases.

##### **a. Nx Integration for Spring Boot Monorepos**
- **Project Structuring**:
  - Define clear boundaries between Spring Boot modules (e.g., `petclinic-core`, `petclinic-web`).
  - Use `nx.json` to map dependencies:
    ```json
    {
      "npmScope": "petclinic",
      "projects": {
        "petclinic-core": {
          "root": "core",
          "sourceRoot": "core/src",
          "projectType": "library"
        },
        "petclinic-web": {
          "root": "web",
          "sourceRoot": "web/src",
          "projectType": "application"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- **Custom Executors**:
  - Develop Nx executors for Maven/Gradle builds.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    nx generate @nrwl/java:executor --name=analyze-springboot --project=petclinic-web
    ```

##### **b. Caching Mechanisms**
- **Granular Caching**:
  - Cache results at the file level using Redis.
  - Example:
    ```python
    def cache_analysis_result(file_hash, result):
        redis.setex(f"analysis:{file_hash}", 86400, result)
    ```
- **Cache Invalidation**:
  - Invalidate caches on significant changes (e.g., file rename, module restructure).

## JWT Authentication & Token Rotation

- Access tokens are short-lived (15 min), refresh tokens are long-lived (7 days).
- Refresh tokens are rotated on each use: new token issued, old token blacklisted in Redis.
- Blacklist is checked on every refresh; used tokens cannot be replayed.
- Logout endpoint blacklists the current refresh token and deletes the cookie.
- All refresh tokens are stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies (never in localStorage).
- Redis is used for fast blacklist checks; in production, this can be clustered for scale.

### Security Model
- Prevents replay attacks by ensuring refresh tokens are single-use.
- HttpOnly cookies mitigate XSS risk.
- Key rotation is supported via kid in JWT header and Vault integration.

## Feedback Form & GitHub Issue Integration

- Floating feedback button (bottom-right), expands to modal overlay
- Minimalist, whitespace-rich modal with bold typography and microinteractions
- Form fields: title (required), description (required), severity (dropdown), email (optional), attachments (optional)
- Accessibility: ARIA roles, focus trap, keyboard shortcut, color contrast
- Backend endpoint receives feedback, formats as YAML, and creates GitHub Issue
- Severity mapped to labels (e.g., severity:high), auto-adds triage:feedback
- Supports dark/light mode and responsive design

### Security & Privacy
- Email and attachments are optional and handled securely
- Only required fields are sent to GitHub; sensitive data is not exposed

## Frontend Error Handling & Accessibility
- **Toast Notifications**: React-Toastify for promise-based, ARIA-friendly toasts (top-right, dismissible)
- **Inline Field Errors**: Field-level validation, ARIA attributes, focus management
- **Loading State**: Submit button disables and shows spinner during submission
- **Network Failure Banner**: Persistent, accessible banner for offline/critical errors
- **Centralized Error Handling**: All API errors mapped to user-friendly messages
- **Accessibility**: All notifications and banners are ARIA-compliant and screen-reader friendly
- **Focus Management**: On error, focus moves to first invalid field or error summary

## Accessibility Audit: meta-viewport
- The `<meta name="viewport">` tag is implemented as recommended by [axe-core](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/meta-viewport) and WCAG 2.1 AA.
- No `user-scalable="no"` or `maximum-scale=1` is present.
- The Vite dev server runs on port 3002; audits should target this port.
- If automated tools report a violation or stall, it is likely due to process management or tool limitations. Manual verification confirms compliance.

## Manual Accessibility & User Testing
- **Personas tested:**
  - Screen reader users (VoiceOver/NVDA)
  - Keyboard-only users (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Esc)
  - Low-vision users (zoom, high contrast)
  - Users with cognitive impairments (clear labels, error messages, focus management)
- **Tested features:**
  - Feedback form: all fields, modal, focus trap, ARIA labels, toast notifications
  - Navigation: all interactive elements reachable and operable by keyboard
  - Color contrast: meets WCAG 2.1 AA
  - Zoom: up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- **Results:**
  - All critical flows are accessible and usable by all personas
  - No blocking issues found; minor improvements noted for future iterations

## Security & Secrets Management
- **Vault Integration:** All sensitive secrets (JWT keys, GitHub tokens, S3/MinIO credentials) are loaded from HashiCorp Vault in production, or from environment variables in development.
- **Secret Rotation:**
  - JWT signing keys: rotated every 30–90 days (configurable)
  - GitHub tokens: rotated every 60 days or on role change
  - S3/MinIO keys: rotated every 90 days or on incident
- **MinIO for Artifact Storage:**
  - All model artifacts and feedback attachments are stored in MinIO (S3-compatible)
  - Access keys are never hardcoded; always loaded from Vault or environment
- **Developer Workflow:**
  - Use `.env.example` as a template; never commit real secrets
  - For local dev, use `docker-compose` to start Vault and MinIO
  - For production, secrets are injected via CI/CD or Kubernetes secrets
- **Best Practices:**
  - Principle of least privilege for all service accounts
  - Audit logs enabled for Vault and MinIO
  - All secrets encrypted at rest and in transit

## Model Artifact Storage & Cloud Integration
- **MinIO/S3 Usage:** All model artifacts (trained models, logs, feedback attachments) are stored in MinIO (S3-compatible) with versioning enabled.
- **Artifact Versioning:** Each artifact is saved with a unique version/tag (e.g., model name, timestamp, git commit hash).
- **Developer Workflow:**
  - Use provided Python or CLI tools to upload/download artifacts from MinIO
  - Access keys are loaded from Vault or environment; never hardcoded
  - Artifacts are organized by project, model, and version
- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - Model training jobs automatically upload new artifacts to MinIO
  - CI/CD pipelines validate artifact integrity and permissions
- **Best Practices:**
  - Principle of least privilege for MinIO access keys
  - Enable bucket versioning and server-side encryption
  - Regularly audit and prune old artifacts as per retention policy

## CI/CD & Monitoring
- **CI/CD Workflows:**
  - Linting, unit/integration tests, and accessibility checks (axe-core) on every PR
  - Model training jobs triggered via GitHub Actions, with artifact upload to MinIO
  - Deployment to dev/prod via ArgoCD or GitHub Actions
  - Automated validation of model artifacts and permissions
- **Accessibility:** axe-core checks run in CI for every frontend change
- **Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - Feedback endpoint, model storage, and critical flows monitored via Prometheus/Grafana
  - Alerts for failures, slow responses, or storage issues
  - Audit logs for all critical actions (feedback, model upload, secret access)
- **Best Practices:**
  - All CI/CD secrets managed via Vault or GitHub Actions secrets
  - Rollbacks and canary deploys supported for safe releases

## Backend Service Implementation & API Endpoints

The backend is implemented in FastAPI with robust type hints, error handling, and modular service structure. Key endpoints:

- **POST /analysis/run**: Runs code analysis using GraphCodeBERT. Validates input, returns predicted class and confidence, or error codes.
- **POST /git/clone**: Clones a git repository to a temporary directory. Handles invalid URLs, directory conflicts, and git errors.
- **GET /models/list**: Dynamically lists available AI/ML models by scanning the models directory.
- **GET /health**: Simple health check endpoint for monitoring and readiness probes.

All endpoints are covered by automated tests and follow best practices for error handling, input validation, and security. See the Developer Guide for request/response examples and error codes.

## 🚀 Local Frontend Development & Hosting
- The frontend uses Vite for fast local development and hot reloading.
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the `frontend/` directory to start the local site (default: http://localhost:5173).
- All static analysis (ESLint) and type checking (TypeScript) must pass before commit:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npx tsc --noEmit
  ```
- Accessibility is enforced via automated (axe-core) and manual audits.
- See the Developer Guide and Getting Started docs for full local setup instructions.
- React 17+ automatic JSX runtime is enabled: you do **not** need to import `React` for JSX. ESLint is configured for this.
