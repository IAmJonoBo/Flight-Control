# Flight Control Milestones & Phases

## Phase 1: Foundation & Scaffolding

- [x] Define project structure and create all directories.
- [x] Scaffold frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind + TypeScript) with branding and stubs.
- [x] Scaffold backend (FastAPI) with health-check endpoint and test stub.
- [x] Scaffold AI/ML (PyTorch/Transformers) with training/inference stubs.
- [x] Scaffold infrastructure (Dockerfiles, docker-compose, k8s, Terraform).
- [x] Scaffold CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Snyk, ArgoCD).
- [x] Scaffold documentation (Docusaurus, Swagger) with stubs.
- [x] Scaffold shared utilities and test stubs for all modules.

## Phase 2: Core Feature Development

- [x] Implement code analysis API endpoints and service logic (mock result, TODOs for ML integration).
- [x] Integrate Monaco Editor and code metrics dashboard in frontend (wired to backend, TODOs for LSP, debouncing, loading state).
- [x] Implement model training, synthetic data generation, and validation scripts (with TODOs for advanced logic).
- [x] Set up database models, migrations, and Redis caching (with TODOs for Alembic and advanced config).
- [x] Develop initial CI/CD pipelines and local dev workflows.

## Phase 3: Integration & Local Validation

- [x] Connect frontend to backend APIs (fully integrated: analysis, git, models, health).
- [x] Validate local development with Docker Compose and CI workflows.
- [x] Run and pass all test stubs (frontend, backend, ai-ml).
- [x] Document setup, contribution, and troubleshooting in Docusaurus.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Cloud Readiness

- [x] Expand backend endpoints (auth, git integration, model management, feedback).
- [x] Add advanced frontend features (diff viewer, settings, docs portal, git clone UI, model selection UI).
- [x] Integrate Kubernetes manifests and Terraform AWS modules.
- [x] Add model retraining and deployment workflows in CI/CD.
- [x] Enhance documentation and accessibility (usage examples, OpenAPI, user guides).
- [x] Add Vault & MinIO deployment guides ([infrastructure/README.md](infrastructure/README.md)).
- [x] Add JWT key rotation and refresh token handling ([backend/README.md](backend/README.md), [docs/src/docs/security.md](docs/src/docs/security.md)).
- [x] Add in-app feedback form and GitHub Issue integration ([docs/src/docs/feedback.md](docs/src/docs/feedback.md)).

## Phase 5: Pilot & Feedback

- [x] Deploy pilot on cloud (AWS, GCP, or local k8s).
- [x] Collect feedback from early users.
- [x] Iterate on features, performance, and documentation.
